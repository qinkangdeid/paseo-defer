/**
 * Carries what is already typed in a session's composer into the Defer message
 * box, so pressing **Defer** with a half-written prompt in front of you does not
 * mean typing it again.
 *
 * Paseo hands a plugin no composer state: `PluginComposerPillContribution.onPress`
 * takes no arguments, and neither the pill props nor the panel props carry the
 * draft (rechecked during the v0.8 migration). What the app *does* do is persist every
 * composer draft itself, under one well-known key, so on a host that keeps that
 * store somewhere a plugin can read — the desktop app and the web app, both of
 * which are ordinary web origins — the text can be read back at the moment the
 * pill is pressed. Everywhere else this quietly finds nothing and the box opens
 * empty, exactly as before.
 *
 * Two things follow from reading a private store rather than being handed the
 * draft, and both are deliberate:
 *
 * - It is a **copy, not a move**. The app's in-memory draft is the source of
 *   truth and does not watch its own storage, so writing to it would be
 *   overwritten and would not clear the composer on screen. The composer says so
 *   in as many words, because a prompt left in the box is one Enter away from
 *   being sent immediately as well as deferred.
 * - Everything here is best effort. A missing key, a schema that moved, another
 *   host: all of them read as "no draft", never as an error.
