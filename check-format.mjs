/**
 * Exercises the timing parsers and formatters directly.
 *
 * Every one of them decides when a message is actually delivered, from text a
 * user typed, and the interesting cases are the ones no type can catch: "9:30"
 * in the afternoon on an AM/PM device, a bare "3" meaning minutes, a wait
 * longer than the plugin will accept. They are pure functions, so this drives
 * them with a fixed `from` and an explicit clock convention rather than
 * whatever locale and time the machine running the check happens to have.
