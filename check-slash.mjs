/**
 * Drives the `/defer` slash command against a host new enough to offer it.
 *
 * Two things need proving that nothing else can see. The first is the
 * feature detection: the contribution is newer than the minimum supported
 * Paseo, so `check-bundles.mjs` models a host without it and never reaches this
 * code at all. The second is what the command does with a line — the reading of
 * `2h ship it` is the whole interface, and the one outcome that must never
 * happen is a message queued for a time the user did not write.
